# 8411 SHARP Robotics Team Code Repository

### How it went
*This was written after our robotics season ended* \
This was my first year coding(I was the main coder for our team) we attended 3 scrimmages, 2 AL Cups, and a TN State Competition. We ended up finishing 2nd for the qualifying matches in the State comp, (TechNova was in 1st big shout out to their insane robot). We had a 50 point autonomous, could hang, somewhat reliably shoot our airplane, and a decent TeleOp. This code was kinda janky to be honest. Hopefully next year I can do better.

UPDATE:
We are now going to worlds due to some other circumstances with the team that won!
