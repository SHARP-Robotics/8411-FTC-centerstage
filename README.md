# 8411 SHARP Robotics Team Code Repository

(As of TN Comp)
Our robotics season has wrapped up, and it's time to review our performance. As a first-time coder for the team, I led the charge through 3 scrimmages, 2 AL Cups, and the TN State Competition.

At the State comp, we snagged 2nd place in qualifying matches, trailing behind TechNova's impressive robot. Our robot had a 50-point autonomous mode, solid hanging skills, and a decent TeleOp. Our code was a bit rough around the edges, but it got the job done.

UPDATE: Some unexpected circumstances bumped us up to Worlds
